##Hi Simple Thread, I hope you like my response to your coding exercise.

You should be able to just clone my repo locally and start it up using

`bin/rails s`

I had fun writing it, and hope you like my approach.

If I was to spend more time on it, I would expand on a few things.  First, the regex is nice, but pretty strict.  I have set it to ignore case, but any change in whitespace will break it.  Also, when uploading files, there is no file type check or size limits in place.  When it comes to error handling, there's a few more ideas that could be implemented, at least.

Since I wrote it in rails and already implemented a file uploader and text field, it would be pretty easy to add a more interactive UI using fields, but I just didn't have the time.

Please reach out if you have any other questions or comments
